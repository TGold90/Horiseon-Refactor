# Horiseon-Refactor 

## Description

The purpose of this project is to clean up unnecessary code, fix broken links and to add semantic HTML tags, and to keep the same visual presentation and intended funcitonality.

- The purpose is so that the client can have a webpage that runs as efficiently ass possible.
- The client's webpage meets modern accsibility standards through semantic html tags and attributes.

In order to achieve this goal I had to replace generic HTML elements and replace them with semantic tags. 

For maximum efficiency and to make the code much easier to read, I removed several unnecessary HTML classes and consolidated the CSS style sheet to get rid of redundant stlyings. I also reoredered the CSS style sheet to match the HTML structure and now follows the same flow.
